- Use pnpm from the root of the project when able
- Use docker rather than pnpm dev, it will likely already be running in the background
- Do not mock or stub out implementations unless I've specifically told you to
- If you don't know the answer to something, say so.  Do not guess.
- Clean up after yourself.  Don't leave a bunch of linter warnings and errors everywhere.
- Don't leave unused or abandoned files laying around everywhere.
